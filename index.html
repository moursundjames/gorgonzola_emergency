    <p class="content">Gorgonzola Emergency has released five studio albums to date. 
        Check them out in the container below!  
        CLIck on each album to see our personal journal entries about the process of making each album, as well as information about track listings, runtimes, and credits.
        We're really hoping to release a total of twenty-two studio albums by the end of the decade. 
        A tremendous "thank you" to our loyal cheese-pant-heads, especially those of you who bought the T-shirts. 
        Sorry we only have XXL.
